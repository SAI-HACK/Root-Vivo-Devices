# Method-1 (Magisk Method)
STEPS
1. Downloading the Flash file of your device from the official website 
2. Extract the firmware (flash file) to a known directory and do not change anything
3. Now search for the "system.img" file in the extracted file folder
4. Download Magisk manager (Download the official file from github only) in another android device
5. Magisk Github Repositry --- https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk
6. Now transfer the "system.img" file to the android device with magisk installed in it and patch the system image file which you transferred
7. rename the magisk patched system image to "system.img" and replace that with the system file in firmware (flash file)
8. Now flash the zip file which contains magisk patched system image in it to your device and check if it is rooted or not.

# After Trying (Method-1)
Errors --- Signature verification failed 
i.e we must find a way to clone the signature of the file and apply it to our altered Firmware.
