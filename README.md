# Method-1 (Magisk Method)
STEPS
1. Downloading the Flash file of your device from the official website 
2. Extract the firmware (flash file) to a known directory and do not change anything
3. Now search for the "system.img" file in the extracted file folder
4. Download Magisk manager (Download the official file from github only) in another android device
5. Magisk Github Repositry --- https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk
6. Now transfer the "system.img" file to the android device with magisk installed in it and patch the system image file which you transferred
7. rename the magisk patched system image to "system.img" and replace that with the system file in firmware (flash file)
8. Now flash the zip file which contains magisk patched system image in it to your device and check if it is rooted or not.

> What is Magisk Doing?


 So basically what Magisk doing is it is extracting your default System image file, patching it, by installing root files into it and repacking it like a completely new system image file but this time with root files integrated to it so that you can get Super SU User or Root Permissions.
 
# After Trying (Method-1)
Errors --- Signature verification failed 
i.e we must find a way to clone the signature of the file and apply it to our altered Firmware.  

# Method - 2 (King root apk method)
STEPS
1. Download king root apk from a reliable source in internet. eg--(https://kingrootapp.net/)
2. Install the apk and grant the required permissions.
3. Go to settings and tap on "Try ROOT" to start the process of rooting.
4. If the rooting process is success your device will reboot or if it does not it is okay in some rare cases.
5. your phone will be rooted after the reboot
6. NOTE:- The reboot is gonna be a bit long so it is good to plug in your mobile device

> What is King Root Doing?

So basically what is kingroot apk doing is. It is trying to find any vulnerabilities or loopholes in your android os and then it is trying to install the root files into the android system directory through that vulnerability. Which means that if you have an OS with good stabilisation and good security then trying kingroot method is just a time waste for you.

# After Trying (Method - 2)
Error --- King root was unable to find any vulnerabilities in Funtouch OS ( I tried both in Latest Device and Old model Device )
> Reasons Might Be
1. Funtouch OS is Really is very much secured. (Because the OTA updates are always very late and also after every update we get see very minor or less bugs in the system so by that we can assume that the OS is pretty much stabilised)
2. As both King root and BBK Devices are chinese companies they might have an unofficial agreement to not give root access to bbk devices (This is my personal opinion though no offence)

### Stil Trying new methods. Updates are yet to come (I Never Give Up On Anything)
